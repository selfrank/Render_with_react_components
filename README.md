About:
This is a follow-up project to a render data through API React activity. I added in a card component utilizing the elements within the json. Each article will display a card with element information and a link to the article. I also added a bootstrap Nav bar with just a boiler plate logo. 

I welcome feedback and look to continue to grow this project.
